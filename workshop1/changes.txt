1 Changed owns association to register, change, remove. Both my reviewers pointed that out and I agree with them.
Register, change and remove are part of the user stories and by including them it helps to make the domain model clearer.

use cases for a description class. For example an item represents a physical item in a store, or another one is
every time an item is sold  a corresponding software instance is deleted. 

3 Changed the grammar of some associations to be more consistent
